Had to create the Build folder (and this Readme file) by hand.  GitHub Desktop did not upload them directly.  I am not sure whether it is a .gitignore thing or something else.  I may need to change the folder name.  I am going to try and upload the files directly.

The .app file is too big.  The .exe and .dll files ought to be small enough.  The folders themselves have too many files.
