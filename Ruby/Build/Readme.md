Had to create the Build folder (and this Readme file) by hand.  GitHub Desktop did not upload them directly.  I am not sure whether it is a .gitignore thing or something else.  I may need to change the folder name.  I am going to try and upload the files directly.

The .app (111.6 MB) file is too big.  The .exe (654 KB) is small enough but the .dll (28.9 MB) is too big (25 MB max).  And the .exe file will not work without the .dll file.  I will need to figure something else out.  By the way, the folders themselves have too many files.
