# RubyUnityTutorial
 Repository for the Unity tutorial called Ruby's Adventure.

This is Michael T. Miyoshi's public repository holding the Unity tutorial called Ruby's Adventure.

I made a repository for the project using GitHub Desktop.  The top level .gitignore file has: Unity, CSharp, VisualStudio, Windows, MacOS.

I made a 2D project in Unity after making the repository for it.  When the project folder was made, I copied an older .gitignore into that folder.  The notes in the file say that it is just a Unity and CSharp .gitignore.  I believe it even says it is an older version for CSharp.  At any rate, using this .gitignore does not require any large file support.  I pushed the repository after I created the "blank" 2D project.

I created a branch for the Ruby Tutorial.  I plan to create new branches from that branch each time I do part of the tutorial.  I also plan to create branches from the main each time I start the tutorial over.  My plan is to do the tutorial each year for a time until I know all the ins and outs of the tutorial.  I also plan to update the readme.md file in main noting some of the quirks in the tutorial.
